\usage{
ff_stack_covariates(
  dem,
  ...,
  resample_method = "near",
  crop = TRUE,
  remove_constant = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dem}{SpatRaster. Digital Elevation Model used as spatial template.
The DEM must be in projected (planar) coordinates and have a valid CRS.}

\item{...}{One or more objects of class SpatRaster, or lists of SpatRaster,
representing environmental covariates (e.g. terrain derivatives, remote
sensing indices, climatic variables, oblique coordinates).}

\item{resample_method}{Character. Resampling method passed to
\code{terra::resample()}. Typical options are \code{"bilinear"},
\code{"near"}, or \code{"bicubic"}. Default is \code{"near"}.}

\item{crop}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), covariates are cropped to the
spatial extent of the DEM before stacking.}

\item{remove_constant}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), covariates with
zero spatial variance (constant layers) are removed from the final stack.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), informative messages about
alignment, cleaning, and final stack size are printed to the console.}
}
\value{
A SpatRaster containing a harmonized stack of covariates aligned to
the DEM grid, ready for extraction and model fitting.
}
\description{
Builds a harmonized stack of environmental covariates for Digital Soil
Mapping (DSM). All covariates are reprojected, resampled, and optionally
cropped using a DEM as the spatial template. The function is intended as a
fast and standardized baseline for DSM workflows, prioritizing robustness
and reproducibility over optimal tuning.
}
\details{
The DEM is treated as the authoritative spatial reference. All input
covariates are forced to match its coordinate reference system, resolution,
and extent. This function does not download or compute covariates; it only
harmonizes existing raster layers.
